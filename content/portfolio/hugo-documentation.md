## Project Overview

This website itself is a project demonstrating the use of **Hugo**, a fast static site generator.

### Transformation from Marp

The original documentation was created using Marp (Markdown Presentation Ecosystem). I transformed the content into a structured Hugo site.

-   **Content Management**: Split the single markdown file into multiple modular content files.
-   **Theme**: Used the **Ananke** theme for a professional look.
-   **Deployment**: The site is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.
